# Ireland-House-Price-Prediction
Using machine learning models to predict property purchase intent and prices in the Dublin, Ireland area.

## Project Overview
Analyzing the Irish Dublin property dataset to explore key factors influencing home buying decisions (location, size, price, energy rating, etc.) and build predictive models:
- **Purchase Intent Prediction**: Binary classification (buy or not buy)
- **House Price Prediction**: Regression (price per square foot)

## Tech Stack
- Python + pandas + scikit-learn
- Multiple machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVM, etc.)
- Complete data preprocessing pipeline (missing value handling, outlier detection, feature engineering)

## Key Results
- **Purchase Prediction**: GBM model accuracy 76%
- **Price Prediction**: Stacking ensemble model R²=0.50
- **Feature Importance**: Identified key factors affecting price

## File Structure
- `Ireland House Price.csv` - Raw dataset
- `annotated-report.docx` - Complete analysis report
- `annotated-code.py` - Python implementation code

## Application Scenarios
- Real estate developer sales strategy optimization
- Homebuyer decision support
- Property market trend analysis
